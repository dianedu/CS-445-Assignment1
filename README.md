The simulation can be run with the command 'python3 simulation.py' in the terminal. For changes to the simulation, the node.py file has constants at the top to change between NODE and EDGE sampling, and to adjust the p value (probability of each node marking a packet). The rate of packets sent from the attacker compared to the normal user, x, is manually changed in the for loops in the simulation.py file.
